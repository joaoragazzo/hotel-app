        <p>The hotel was founded by Joseph Elias, a visionary with a passion for hospitality and a deep love for
            Jacarta. Originally built as a private mansion, the building was transformed into a hotel to share the
            beauty of Jacarta with visitors from around the world.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Hotel Hotel has seen numerous renovations and expansions, each carefully designed to preserve
            the building's original character while incorporating modern amenities and design elements. Our hotel stands
            as a testament to Jacarta's rich history, with architectural details and d√©cor that reflect the local
            culture and heritage.</p>
